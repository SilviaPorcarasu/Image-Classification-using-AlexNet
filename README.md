# Image-Classification-using-AlexNet
This project applies AlexNet, a CNN, to classify images from a reduced Stanford Dogs Dataset (8 classes). Images were resized and normalized. Three training setups were tested: clean data with SGDM, noisy data with SGDM, and clean data with Adam. Results showed SGDM on clean data gave the best performance.
